Two docker build files are provided in order to run a miner in a Docker container.

* full node - for run a full node that secures the network, check out the [node](./node) directory - SSL certificates and a domain is required for this type of set up.
* dumb node - a dumb node can still mine but will not contribute to securing the network - this method is recommended for beginners - see the [dumb node](./dumb) directory
